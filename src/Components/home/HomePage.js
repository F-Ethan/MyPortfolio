      The Class took us through the basics of programming. It started in C and then worked its way into \
      JavaScript. After JavaScrip we Learned the basics of Python. Then We went into how to use a simple \
      framework like Flask and for the Final in the class we had to build a paper trading Stock market App. \
      After finishing the class I taught myself how to use Django and Beautiful Soup.",

      Basics of JavaScript I found that I loved to program, However I could not figure out how to make my \

      it too. However as I started to learn about react I relived that one of my problems was that what I was comparing my work to\
      was using advanced Javascript languages to control the state of their code. I was trying to make my projects look and act like\
      web applications without knowing that they were using whole frameworks I had never heard of. Now as I build complexe\

      with both front and back ends that would dynamically load and update when anything changes. However the more I learned about Angular the more\
      I came to love the Framework. To me Angular seems fairly similar to Django, It has a very clean layout that makes it easy to organize your code. \
      It also come with so much functionality right from the start, making it easy to Authenticate your users and and handel the routing within \
      your applications",
